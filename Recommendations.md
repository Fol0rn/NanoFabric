# Shader recommendations
1. **Mellow Shader**, gives the best performance and stability while giving good visuals, and will be up to date on Minecraft versions for you to enjoy.
2. **MakeUp-UltraFast**, gives good performance and stability while giving better visual but with worse performance as the downside, but will be in every version 
     on Minecraft.
