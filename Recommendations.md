# Shader recommendations
1. ***Mellow Shader***, gives the best performance and stability while giving good visuals, and will be up to date on Minecraft versions for you to enjoy.
2. ***MakeUp-UltraFast***, gives good performance and stability while giving better visual but with worse performance as the downside, but will be in every version 
     on Minecraft.

# ResourcePack recommendations
- ***For Better Animations***
1. ***Fresh Animation***, adds more unique and better animations for every Mob, making the experience better.
 - ***Fresh Animations - Extensions***, adds more things for **Fresh Animation** like Creeper edits, more details in pigs, chickens, cows and many more that I           can not explain to not waste your time
3. ***Detailed Animations***, like **Fresh Animation** it makes animation look better, but not the Mobs this time, this time its the players aka you, adding many 
    animations to make your avatar not feel stiff and empty

- ***For Better Looks***
1. ***Bare Bones***, it makes blocks and items more simple and a recreation from the **Minecraft Trailers** but yet... making it still enjoyable
